If we can't determine where the data ends, we can't process it properly. Even if we attempt to process it, it would only lead to issues.

Imagine your job is to process a sentence, word by word, adding punctuation, setting capitalization, and so on as you go. Data arrives word by word, but you donâ€™t know how much will be sent, and there may be delays.

Example:
They send ['the', 'sentence', 'ends] in one go. What would you do?
Wait for more or process the data?

You wait a bit more, and the data becomes:
['the', 'sentence', 'ends', 'when', 'you', 'start', 'to', 'think', 'about']

Do you wait more or process it?

You wait a bit more:
['the', 'sentence', 'ends', 'when', 'you', 'start', 'to', 'think', 'about', 'where', 'it', 'begins']

A bit more:
['the', 'sentence', 'ends', 'when', 'you', 'start', 'to', 'think', 'about', 'where', 'it', 'begins', "it's", 'just', 'a', 'matter', 'of', 'when', 'ends', 'begins']

The same problem applies to requests.
#### How do we know when a request ends and other starts?

Before we answer that question, we need to understand basics of a request.
##### Parts of a request:

1. Request line
2. Headers
3. Body

Request line: This is one line long and ends with `\r\n`(CR-LF) 
method + path + http version
`GET /test1234 HTTP/1.1`

Headers: Provides additional information about the request. Each header line ends with `\r\n`.  
The header section is terminated by **two** `\r\n` (CR-LF) sequences.
`Host: example.com\r\n`

Body: This is used to transfer information (e.g., form data, JSON payloads, etc.).

Example request:
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/burp_cr_lf_get.png)

This part is fine but what about if our request had a body?

==Note: You can send any http request with body, such as GET, POST,PUT,UPDATE..., apparently except for TRACE(?)==
==But whether it will be accepted or not depends on the server.==

Example Post Request:

![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_request_1.png)
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_response_1.png)

![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_request_2.png)

![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_response_2.png)

A few example of different Content-Type:

![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/httpbin/httpbin_0.png)
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/httpbin/httpbin_1.png)
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/httpbin/httpbin_2.png)
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/httpbin/httpbin_3.png)

What would happen if we change the Content-Length?

Uncheck "Update Content-Length", so burp won't update content-length header

![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_request_4.png)

![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_response_4.png)

Content-Length: 4
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_request_5.png)
![](../Images/2-%20Line%20en/post_requests/post_response_5.png)
Even though we sent test=abc, server only read up to Content-Length's value.
(Content-Length: 4, means 4 bytes. Each char is 1 byte. \r 1 byte, \n 1 byte)

Since we talk about how do we know when a request ends, the answer is we do not. That's why we use Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding headers to determine length of a request/response.

We saw how Content-Length works above, let's see how Transfer-Encoding: chunked works.

Chunked: 
This is normally used when we don't know how much data is going to send/received.

Structure:

```
length\r\n
data\r\n

length1\r\n
data1\r\n

0\r\n
\r\n
```
length: length of the data as bytes in hexadecimal
note: above example just for demonstration, there isn't space between chunks.
see below:

5\r\n
cool_\r\n
9\r\n
gallipoli\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
