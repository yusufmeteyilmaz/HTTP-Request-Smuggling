Important Note!!!
HTTP Request Smuggling only appear under 1 circumstances:

- You have to fool whoever sends or receives data.

But if we expand that little bit, there is only 2 types of http request smuggling:
-  Client Side Desync Attacks (Between Client-Server)
- Server Side Desync Attacks (Between X-Server, X could be anything, reverse proxy, waf, load balancer..) 

Client Side Desync Attack:

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/client-server.png)

In Client-Server type, client must exploit it's own connection!
What does it mean?
It depends how you interpret "Client", in todays world most people use "Browsers" to browse the internet, so exploiting these makes more sense.
But idea is always the same, so you can apply same idea on all http client & servers.

In this context, we take Client = Browsers. 
Such as Firefox, firefox nightly, firefox developer, and others. (chrome, opera..)

But you would ask why & how would something could happen?
Answer is really really simple.
- Client sends 1 request, expects 1 response.
- Server interprets that more than 1 request, sends 1 response, start waiting remaining data.
- Client receives response, sends another request.
- Server receives that request, but thinks this is not a request, it is just remaining data of previous request, sends back response.
- Client sent 2 requests, received 2 response. Nice!

Example:

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/client-server_coool_1.png)

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/client-server_coool_2.png)

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/client-server_coool_3.png)

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/client-server_coool_4.png)

Malicious request has affected normal request, malicious.js loaded in victim's browser. (301 redirects to attacker's site)
This was client side desync attack.

That could happen any time while you are browsing the web!

Server Side Desync Attacks: (X-Server)

In this type, the attacker's goal is to exploit the connection between the server and whatever is in front of it. Even if the attacker is able to smuggle a request into that connection, there is no guarantee that they can affect other users; it depends on the server configuration.

Example:
![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/server_side_0.png)

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/server_side_1.png)

The attacker can use HTTP request smuggling for their own benefit in both scenarios. However, they cannot affect users in the second scenario because each user has a separate connection, and they are not using the same one.

In second example attacker can only exploit himself, because there isn't shared single tcp connection like in the first example. 

Why would attacker want to exploit HRS in second example?
- Maybe he want to bypass some firewall rule? /admin
- Maybe he wants to steal some internal headers
- Curiosity

Btw it is called http request tunneling

---------------------
I want to fix a few things I explained in the video. So, the following part is not a continuation of the above.

(skip images)

![](../Images/3-%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/response_queue_poisoning_self.png)

![](../Images/3-%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/response_queue_poisoning_self_1.png)
![](../Images/3-%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/response_queue_poisoning_self_2.png)

![](../Images/3-%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/response_queue_poisoning_self_3.png)

![](../Images/3-%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/response_queue_poisoning_self_4.png)

When I made these images I didn't quite understand how requests split & merge each other (I made them to understand myself), I just said "yeah leftovers just concatenate each other".
My mistake was thinking about requests "as whole". When I saw a request in wireshark, I said "ooooo that must be a 1 request". There isn't something called a request on client site, I am not the one who decides it, it is server.
It isn't a request until it reaches the server, it is just byte stream, data flow.

So above images not possible under normal conditions (e.g., when both client and server applies RFC.) (there is a catch keep reading!)

I thought:
- Client sends a request
- Backend receives that request and process it as 2 request
- Backend send 2 responses
- Client only takes first response

Note: I am trying to smuggle request on my connection to cause response queue poisoning.
But that is not possible, why:
- When I send a request, I would expect a response
- When I send 2 requests, I would expect 2 responses
There is no way I expect more than I sent.

Note: how I send and how I receive is really important too. 

First request:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: coolcat\r\n\r\n
```
Second request:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: deadbeef\r\n\r\n
```
(one tcp connection)

I can send them as I like.
It is just data, my goal is transmitting it, it doesn't matter if it is whole or not.

First request:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Ho
```
Second request:
```
st: coolcat\r\n\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: deadbeef\r\n\r\n
```

In backend they are both seen as like that:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: coolcat\r\n\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: deadbeef\r\n\r\n
```

When backend sees them, it will send responses immediately.

Example:
- I sent ReqA+ReqB
- Backend sends me RespA
- Backend sends me RespB
- I sent ReqC
- Backend sends me RespC

Let me send ReqA as half: (ReqA1+ReqA2= ReqA)
- I sent ReqA1
- Backend waits
- I sent ReqA2 + ReqB + ReqC
- Backend sends RespA, RespB, RespC
We can't cause queue poisoning here.

BUT:
Everything depends on what we try to exploit!!!
Imagine we can send requests from victim browser. (e.g., victim visits site that we own)
We can try to exploit hrs in client's browser directly.

We want to use cause http request smuggling.

Our first goal is to make our first request affect second request.
(if calling request confuses you can just call it as data)

But we can't send it in parts because browser won't allow it.
e.g.
First request: (first data)
```
GET /something HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: example.com\r\n\r\n

GET /maliciouspage HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: example.com\r\n
X: X
```

Second request: (second data)
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: example.com\r\n\r\n
```

First request will affect second request.
Backend only see 2 requests, so it will send 2 responses.
And clients expects 2 responses, nothing seems wrong at first sight.

If we do above example first data's leftover should concatenate other data in the backend.

Let's confirm it with Burp: (you may want to use wireshark too)

This is attack request:
![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/attack_req.png)
This is normal request:
![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/normal_req.png)

Send them in same connection:
![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/result.png)

Nice! It works on burp suite, now we need to do that on browser but it is not that easy, does it?
We can't send splitted data (half request etc.) or we can't modify content-length header. Browsers don't allow dangerous operations.

To do that we need specific conditions, e.g., backend should ignore CL header.

https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/browser/client-side-desync

(I'll add lab here if I ever create one)

Key point:
How much response does sender expect when they send data?
(we are still trying to exploit ourselves not others)

![](../Images/3-%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/response_queue_poisoning_self.png)

This image not possible, because when we try to exploit ourselves.
Like sending 1 request in burp, we will get 1 response no matter what.
We can't cause above scenario.

An example to understand requests better:

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/1_or_2_request.png)

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/1_or_2_wireshark.png)

Tell me is it 1 request or 2?

You would say "HEAD request can't have body, server would see that as 2 requests, you didn't even need to specify CL header".

Yes, what about this?
![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/1_or_2_request_1.png)

![](../Images/3.5%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling/1_or_2_wireshark_1.png)

If server completely ignored Content-Length header, it should have return
2 responses. First response would 200 other one 403 or something like that.

What server did:
- Server saw a head request with CL header, but processed it.
- Read 4 bytes, returned error because it saw a head request with body.
- Continued reading because connection isn't closed yet.
- It is just a normal request to /404, returned 404

See something funny:
https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/551
Should get have body or not? 

You see someone says yes someone says no, and that confusion leads bugs, vulnerabilities.

Here is a really cool basic example by LiveUnderflow:
https://youtu.be/dnyL7EKbRRk?feature=shared

He says forget about everything, http, tcp.
Just think it as reading bytes from socket.
